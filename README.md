Bubble Sorting Visualizer for Android
This Android Kotlin project is a visualization tool for the Bubble Sort algorithm. Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

Features
Bubble Sort Visualization: Watch the step-by-step execution of the Bubble Sort algorithm on an array.
Android App: The project is implemented in Kotlin for Android, making it easy to run and test on Android devices.
